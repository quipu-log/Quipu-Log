//! # quipu-middleware
//!
//! Async audit-logging middleware on top of [`quipu_core`]:
//!
//! - [`pipeline`]: event-driven, non-blocking writer with retries, a
//!   disk-backed dead-letter queue and a programmable fallback hook
//! - [`filter`]: programmable pre/post filters that can exempt requests from
//!   auditing or enrich events after the response is known
//! - [`permissions`]: who may emit and who may query audit logs
//! - [`layer`]: a `tower` Layer that proxies HTTP services per endpoint and
//!   emits audit events automatically
//! - [`metrics`] / [`health`]: lock-free pipeline counters (queue depth, DLQ
//!   size, write latency, ...) and health flags (writer liveness, disk-full
//!   latch, low-disk warning), readable from any handle clone without
//!   touching the writer thread
